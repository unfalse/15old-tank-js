# 15 old tank.js

This is somehow simplified and rewritten on Javascript version of [Battle Tank (Ufa edition)](https://github.com/unfalse/Battle-Tank--TP-7.0-).

Features:

-   no detailed graphics, only primitives
-   more smooth keyboard controls but with issues due to keyboard API implementation in browsers

You can try it [here](http://unfalse.github.io/15old-tank-js/)
